        <h2 id="what-is-ethlimo">What is ETH.LIMO?</h2>

        <p>
          A decentralized alternative to Cloudflare’s often unreliable eth.link
          service, LIMO functions as a drop-in replacement for eth.link; a Web
          2.0 infrastructure stack for resolving Ethereum Name Service (ENS)
          records and associated IPFS content (Web 3.0). LIMO allows users and
          dApp developers to effortlessly access and host static sites built
          with a combination of IPFS and ENS.
        </p>
        <p>
          LIMO is intended to be operated as a reliable and secure public good
          for all users. Once the LIMO project has completed Alpha testing it
          will be released with an open source license and maintained as a
          community project for the purposes of encouraging others to operate
          their own decentralized ENS/IPFS gateways.
        </p>

        <h2 id="why-limo">Why do we need ETH.LIMO?</h2>

        <p>
          Core internet infrastructure is becoming increasingly centralized and
          as such, several existential threats have emerged that undermine the
          principles of an decentralized, open and free internet:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Single points of failure (Cloudflare, CDNs, etc)</li>
          <li>Eth.link is unreliable</li>
          <li>
            All ENS gateway infrastructure is currently operated by a single entity
            (Cloudflare)
          </li>
          <li>Censorship</li>
          <li>Lack of non-commercial infrastructure</li>
          <li>
            Opacity of terms of service agreements and moderation policies
          </li>
          <li>
            Proliferation of proprietary browser extensions which require
            centralized services (Unstoppable domains, etc…)
          </li>
          <li>The erosion of the “commons” and “public space”</li>
          <li>Web 3.0 adoption is still nascent</li>
          <li>Most browsers cannot natively access ENS/IPFS</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          For end users, this means a limited selection of poor quality services
          that increasingly resemble a cable TV package. Accessing the dWeb can
          be a frustrating experience if eth.link is unavailable.
        </p>
        <p>
          For dApp developers, this leads to a limited selection of platforms
          and services in addition to lost revenue. As an alternative to
          eth.link for users and dApp developers, any existing eth.link site can
          be accessed with eth.limo in the same manner.
        </p>
        <p>
          The LIMO project brings additional resiliency to dApps by providing an
          alternative means of access as a public good. Application owners can
          directly participate in the governance of LIMO, thus giving key
          stakeholders voting privileges for the services they depend upon. As
          the decentralized web continues to grow, it is imperative that
          community projects facilitate the transition from Web 2.0 to Web 3.0.
        </p>

        <h2 id="how-limo-works">How does ETH.LIMO work?</h2>

        <p>LIMO operates as a reverse proxy for ENS names and IPFS content.</p>

        <p>
          Much like eth.link, LIMO uses a wildcard DNS record *.eth.limo to
          dynamically capture requests for all ENS domains. The LIMO service 
          automatically resolves the IPFS content hash of the requested ENS 
          record and returns the corresponding static content over HTTPS. 
          Since native IPFS resolution capabilities are missing from the 
          majority of browsers, ETH.LIMO represents a bridge from the “normal” 
          internet to the decentralized one.
        </p>
        <p>
          Zero-configuration is required in order to access or host a site or
          dApp on ETH.LIMO, making ETH.LIMO an excellent no-cost solution for
          providing Web 2.0 access to your project.
        </p>

        <h2 id="security-privacy">Security and Privacy</h2>

        <p>
          The LIMO project enforces strong origin isolation policies for all
          resources by default. Projects accessed through ETH.LIMO automatically
          receive security hardened browser headers and all client data is
          encrypted with TLSv1.3 (default) or TLSv1.2 using the latest
          ciphersuites. All log data is fully anonymized, which prevents the
          ability to uniquely identify any single user.
        </p>
